# Sanity Clean Content Studio

Congratulations, you have now installed the Sanity Content Studio, an open source real-time content editing environment connected to the Sanity backend.

Now you can do the following things:

- [Read “getting started” in the docs](https://www.sanity.io/docs/introduction/getting-started?utm_source=readme)
- [Join the community Slack](https://slack.sanity.io/?utm_source=readme)
- [Extend and build plugins](https://www.sanity.io/docs/content-studio/extending?utm_source=readme)

## Configuring new pages in Sanity studio

### Page naming convention

**< section-name > - < descriptor > - < order-number > - < status >**

ex: **"offense-fish-1-cont"** -> in the offense section, the first page of the fishing violation questions, and the page is not an end page, so we continue.
